# empythy
Empythy is a Non violent communication helper chat bot that was wrote in python than became a GDScript Open Source project!
Well this project started as a little python study experiment and it was only one word program.
Godot Ai.gd project is what matters now! (Because The .py needs a serious update on the search!) 

The godot project can read a text and pick words from it. It Substitute dots "." and commas "," with " " spaces 
and also adds and extra space at the end of the new_text input ! 
That makes the trick that differs "safe " from "safety ". Got it?)

It also reads a few commands like: help, new, feelings, and needs.

So My Name is Diego Ferrari Bruno and I think, code, and make it happen the most prototyped way as possible.
I hope you can understand my code! if not, just ask me, i will be happy to help if i can. And if my hand is not hurt.
